# MkDocs Website

This repository contains the source code for my MkDocs website. This project is part of my learning journey to understand how to create and host documentation using MkDocs.

## About the Project

I created this MkDocs website to gain hands-on experience with:

- Setting up a basic MkDocs project.
- Writing documentation in Markdown.
- Configuring MkDocs to suit my needs.
- Hosting the documentation on GitHub Pages.

## What I Learned

Throughout this project, I learned:

- How to install and configure MkDocs.
- The structure of MkDocs projects and the role of the `mkdocs.yml` configuration file.
- Using Markdown to write clear and structured documentation.
- Integrating and customizing MkDocs themes.
- Deploying a static site to GitHub Pages.
